\section{Security Analysis}
\label{sec:security}

For detailed security analysis of our scheme, let suppose that Alice is the
owner of a small enterprise named Digitals. Alice wants to outsource her
employees related confidential data files $\mathcal{F} = \langle \mathcal{F}_1,
\mathcal{F}_2, \ldots, \mathcal{F}_n \rangle$ to the cloud server,
owned by Eve, in text format meanwhile she also wants to allow searching on the outsourced data
to his employee Bob, the HR manager of Digitals. Eve being a non-trusted third
party, Alice ensures privacy and confidentiality of $\mathcal{F}$ by
first encrypting $\mathcal{F}$ and corresponding index files $\mathcal{I}
= \langle \mathcal{I}_1, \mathcal{I}_2, \ldots, \mathcal{I}_n \rangle$ with
$\sigma_{pk}$ and then outsource them to Eve.

\subsection{Man in the middle attack}

Let a malicious user $M$ intercepts a user query $Q$. $M$ cannot learn about $Q$
as he does not have $\sigma_{sk}$ so $Q$ is secure. But $M$ can manipulate $Q$ to
produce $\acute{Q}$. $M$ can replace $k\omega$ in $Q$ with his own
$\acute{k}\omega$ encrypted with $\sigma_{pk}$. Eve won't notice if the query is been altered in
the midaway or not. Eve will evaulate the query and sends $\mathcal{R}_q$ to the user.
User will also won't notice that $\mathcal{R}_q$ is the outcome of an altered query.
User may notice unwanted information in the result but won't notice the
missing records due to replacement of his keyword by $M$.

\subsection{Malicious Eve}

Let Eve has malicious intentions and wants to know about $\mathcal{I}$ and
user queries. As Eve won’t have $\sigma_{sk}$ so he cannot decrypt $\mathcal{I}$
thus cannot learn anything. Also, all the comparisons between bloom filter of user
query and $\mathcal{I}$ are being done by using homomorphic properties
of Pascal Paillier~\cite{pascal_AHE} so Eve cannot determine the outcome of the
comparisons. Neither he could determine any search pattern for subsequent queries from different users.

\subsection{Insider Attack}

Alice’s $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{I}$ will be secured against Insider attacks as
well. If some malicious employee $E$, who has access to Eve’s data centers,
stole Eve’s data then $E$ won’t be able to access any useful information of Digitals
employees as without $\sigma_{sk}$ indexes cannot be decrypted.

\subsection{Malicious user M and Eve teamed up}

Let malicious user $M$ having some background information of Digitals teamed up
with Eve to find out confidential information about Digitals employees. They
both cannot learn anything about the user query and the indexes on the cloud.
Malicious user cannot decrypt the user query and Eve cannot know the comparisons
output.

\subsection{Malicious user’s random query}

Let malicious user $M$ having $\sigma_{pk}$, creates a semantically correct query
and sends to Eve for evaluation. Eve will perform comparisons and will return
$\mathcal{R}_q$ but $M$ won’t be able to determine $\mathcal{M}_q$ as he does not
have the $\sigma_{sk}$ to decrypt $\mathcal{R}_q$ returned by Eve. He will
receive $\mathcal{R}_q$ but he won’t be able to learn any information out of it.
