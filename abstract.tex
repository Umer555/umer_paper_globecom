Consumer data, such as documents, photos and videos, are increasingly being
stored in the cloud. Much of this data is confidential and hence needs to be
encrypted to protect it from intruders in case the cloud service provider gets
compromised. However, this makes it difficult to search the encrypted data 
directly. Recent approaches to enable searching of this encrypted data
have relied on trapdoors, locally stored indexes, and homomorphic encryption.
However, these techniques limit search capabilities either to a small set of 
pre-defined keywords or only allow exact keyword matching.

This paper addresses the problem of similarity-based search over
outsourced encrypted data while ensuring end-to-end privacy. This enables users
to search using keywords that only partially match the originally stored words.
We implement partial matching using sliding window bloom filters and secure
search over arbitrary keywords using homomorphic encryption. Crucially, by 
avoiding the need to send back the entire encrypted bloom filter index to the 
client, we reduce the cost of communicating results to the client by over 95\%.
Our results demonstrate that search queries with 2 to 10 keywords
only cost \$0.00001 to \$0.00004 per 1000 similar requests.
